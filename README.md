## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive example of how to set up and implement an automated test suite using popular Java testing technologies. This test suite includes test cases for different features of a demo web application, ensuring reliability and coverage.

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE8**: The programming language used to write the test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating web application testing.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used to manage project dependencies and build configuration.
- **TestNG**: A testing framework that facilitates test execution, management, and reporting.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 8**: Ensure you have Java JDK 8 installed.
- **Maven**: Download and install Maven.
- **Browser and WebDriver**: Download and configure the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
- **IDE**: An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running tests.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visconttig/Selenium-Testing2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Selenium-Testing
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

```

- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file for managing dependencies and build settings.

## Running the Tests

To execute the test suite, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will compile the test suite and run all the tests using TestNG.

## Reporting

TestNG generates a default report upon test execution. After running the tests, you can find the test reports in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. Additionally, you might configure a more advanced reporting tool like Allure or ExtentReports for enhanced test reporting.
